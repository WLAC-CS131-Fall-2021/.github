# WLAC CS 131 Fall 2021

This organization will host the code for everyone's projects in seperate repositories. Currently everyone should be added to the organization as a collaborator and should have the ability to create and modify the associated repos. If you don't have access email me at [lshamsschaal@gmail.com](mailto:lshamsschaal@gmail.com?subject=CS%20131%20Add%20Collaborator).

### Adding your project

1. [Create a new repo](https://github.com/organizations/WLAC-CS131-Fall-2021/repositories/new) in this organization
2. Upload your project files to the repo
    1. If you only have a couple of files you can [add them individually through the website](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository).
    2. For larger or more complex projects I would recommend using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to upload your project
3. [Create a file named "README.md"](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in your repo to talk about what your project is and provide relevant information and links.

Once complete, your repo will then be publically accessible. Feel free to explore other projects in the repositories tab of the organization.
